Global root zone storage capacity HTESSEL
This script is used in chapter 6 of the PhD dissertation of F. van Oorschot (May 2024).
The script provides an analysis of global root zone storage capacity representation with:
(1) predicted using a random forest model; (2) theoretical root zone representation in HTESSEL; (3) effective root zone representation in HTESSEL.
